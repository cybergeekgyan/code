### Technical Requirements

   - You can download Putty from https://www.putty.org

### Tips:

- You can shutdown your EC2 instance when you’re not using it. This will help you to save money.

- When you create your first EC2 Instance, you will create and download a private key file. P
- lease save it in a safe directory. 
- Don’t lose this file. 
- You will need it to login to your AWS EC2 Instance.


- If you’re using Windows and using Putty, then you will need to configure Putty to be
	able to login to your EC2 Instance. 
    
    - Here’s a video that shows how to do that.
