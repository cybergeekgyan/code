## Home-Monitoring-and-Control-Raspberry-Pi-Alarm-System

* Building a custom home monitoring system with a Raspberry Pi with some inexpensive hardware and simple web services.

### Features
* We can monitor our house remotely via 

     * photo or video surveillance, 
     * detect motion, 
     * turn lights on and off, and 
     * send messages to our phone when different alarms are triggered.

**This DIY electronics project provides simple directions for getting our home monitoring system up and running.** 

 - Selecting a power supply, camera, motion detector, enclosure, and other components and accessories, and 

 - Making our system "smart" by connecting to web services frameworks such as Weaved and WebIOPi. 
 
 - Then programming the logic to make our Pi camera take pictures and stream video, connect to home peripherals, and mount our alarm system. 
  
 - With this, we can create a fully autonomous system that helps us and our family feel more secure at home and away.


*Note:* These instructions work with Raspberry Pi B, Raspberry Pi B+, and Raspberry Pi 2 models.

### Objectives/Steps 

  - Selecting hardware, including a Raspberry Pi camera and a Pi Cobbler
  - Configuring VNC, SSH, and WebIOPi services
  - Sending SMS messages with the Raspberry Pi
  - Taking and accessing pictures remotely
  - Setting up video streaming with a Raspberry Pi camera
  - Connecting the Pi to the development board
  - Connecting the relay and motion detector
  - Programming the alarm in Python
  - Mounting and securing the alarm system
